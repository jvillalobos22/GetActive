# Get Active SPA

This project is an Angular 1.5 app that was designed and developed by Juan Villalobos for his senior capstone project at CSU Chico. A demo of this project can be found at [juanvillalobos.me/getActive](http://juanvillalobos.me/getActive).

You can create a login or use the login `juan@juan.com` and password `juan` to gain access to the demo.

## Purpose

The idea behind getActive is to allow users to create and find local sporting events. This would help connect users with others that have similar sport and outdoor activity interests in their area. Each event can have a minimum or maximum amount of players required. Once you create an event, it will show as pending until the minimum amount of users join the event, at which point the status of the event will become green and change from *Pending* to *On*.

## Technology
